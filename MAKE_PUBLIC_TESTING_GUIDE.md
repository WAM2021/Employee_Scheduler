# 🌐 Making Repository Public and Testing Auto-Update

## ✅ Step 1: Make Repository Public

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/WAM2021/Employee_Scheduler
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (far right in the repository menu)
3. **Scroll down to the "Danger Zone"** section at the bottom
4. **Click "Change repository visibility"**
5. **Select "Make public"**
6. **Type "Employee_Scheduler"** to confirm
7. **Click "I understand, change repository visibility"**

## ✅ Step 2: Create a GitHub Release

**After making the repo public:**

1. **Go to your repository main page**
2. **Click "Releases"** (on the right side)
3. **Click "Create a new release"**
4. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Tag version**: `v1.1.0`
   - **Release title**: `Employee Scheduler v1.1.0 - Auto-Update Ready`
   - **Description**:
     ```
     🎉 Auto-Update System Implemented!
     
     ✨ New Features:
     - Version display in application title
     - Automatic update checking on startup
     - Manual update checking via Help menu
     - Background download with progress tracking
     
     📥 Installation: Download Employee_Scheduler.exe below
     ```
5. **Upload the executable**: Drag `dist\Employee_Scheduler.exe` to the assets area
6. **Click "Publish release"**

## ✅ Step 3: Test Auto-Update

**After creating the release:**

1. **Run the test version**: `.\dist\Employee_Scheduler_Test.exe`
   - This is version 1.0.0 (should show "Work Scheduler" in title)
   
2. **What should happen**:
   - App starts normally
   - Background update check occurs
   - Update dialog appears showing v1.1.0 is available
   - You can download and install the update
   - App restarts showing "Work Scheduler v1.1.0"

3. **Manual test**:
   - In the app, go to **Help → Check for Updates**
   - Should show the same update dialog

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If update check still fails:**
- Verify repository is actually public (you can view it without logging in)
- Check that the release was created with the .exe file attached
- Ensure your internet connection is working

**If no update dialog appears:**
- Check if any antivirus/firewall is blocking the connection
- Try the manual update check via the Help menu

## 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ **Repository accessible**: Can view https://github.com/WAM2021/Employee_Scheduler without login  
✅ **Release created**: Visible at https://github.com/WAM2021/Employee_Scheduler/releases  
✅ **Update check works**: Test app shows update dialog for v1.1.0
