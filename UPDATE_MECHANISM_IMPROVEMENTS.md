# 🔧 Auto-Update Mechanism Improvements

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Previous Issue:**
- **Error**: "Failed to load Python DLL 'python210.dll'"
- **Cause**: PyInstaller creates temporary DLL files that get locked while the app is running
- **Problem**: Batch file couldn't properly replace the executable while DLLs were still in use

### **New Solution:**
✅ **PowerShell Script**: More robust than batch files for process management  
✅ **Proper Delays**: Waits for the application to fully exit before replacement  
✅ **Retry Logic**: Attempts file replacement multiple times if initially blocked  
✅ **Backup System**: Creates backup of current version before updating  
✅ **Clean Shutdown**: Forces proper application termination to release file handles  
✅ **Detached Process**: Update script runs independently from the main application  

## 🧪 **Testing the New Update Process:**

### **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Update Dialog Appears**: Shows v1.1.0 is available
2. **Click "Download & Install"**: Progress dialog appears
3. **Download Completes**: Shows installation confirmation
4. **Click "Yes" to Install**: 
   - Application closes immediately
   - PowerShell script runs in background (hidden)
   - After 5-6 seconds, new version starts automatically
   - Title shows "Work Scheduler v1.1.0"

### **What the PowerShell Script Does:**
1. **Waits 3 seconds** for app to fully exit
2. **Creates backup** of current executable
3. **Waits 2 more seconds** for file handles to release
4. **Tries to replace file** up to 5 times with delays
5. **Starts new version** if successful
6. **Restores backup** if update fails
7. **Cleans up** temporary files and itself

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Update Still Fails:**
1. **Check antivirus**: Some AV software blocks file replacements
2. **Run as administrator**: May need elevated permissions
3. **Close other instances**: Make sure no other copies are running
4. **Check disk space**: Ensure enough space for backup + new file

### **Manual Recovery:**
If update fails, the script should automatically restore the backup. If not:
1. Look for `Employee_Scheduler.exe.backup` in the same folder
2. Rename it back to `Employee_Scheduler.exe`

### **Verification:**
- ✅ **No DLL errors** during update process
- ✅ **Clean application shutdown** before replacement
- ✅ **Automatic restart** with new version
- ✅ **Version number** appears in title bar

## 📝 **Testing Notes:**

**Current Test Setup:**
- **Test Version**: Employee_Scheduler_Test_v2.exe (v1.0.0)
- **Target Update**: v1.1.0 from GitHub release
- **Expected Result**: Seamless update without DLL errors

The improved mechanism should completely eliminate the Python DLL loading error! 🎉
